 <h2><li>Origin of the name</li></h2>

<p>
It is believed that the name of Siwan district comes from the name of a Bandh king whose successors ruled the region for a long time. The king’s name was Shivan Man and hence the name Siwan. It is also believed that even Maharajganj, a part of Siwan district, must have got its name from
the Maharaja who ruled here. siwan is also known by the name Aliganj Sawan, after Ali Bux, one of the feudal lords who dominated the region.There is also another story regarding the naming of Siwan. In Bhojpuri language, the word ‘Siwan’ denotes ‘border of a place’. It forms the southern border of Nepal, hence the name. Whatever the real reason, Siwan has much importance in the history of India, not just the modern history but even ancient history.

Don, a village located in the Darauli region, has the ruins of a fort, believed to have belonged to the great guru in Mahabharata, who taught Kauravas and Pandavas and who was a leading figure in the Mahabharata war.In fact, his son Ashwadhama is believed to be still wandering the earth because of a curse by Lord Krishna for killing the sons of the Pandavas. Don is also known for a stupa, which is believed to have the vase in which Buddha’s ashes were kept. It is believed that Don was the name of a local Brahmin who helped the dispute among the last followers of Buddha regarding how Buddha’s ashes could be distributed.As a token of gratitude, the vase which contained the ashes was given to Don. He built a stupa to place the vase. The stupa though in ruins is still a revered place for Buddhists. In fact, the famous Chinese traveller, Hiusen Tsang has mentioned about Don in his travelogue. It is also believed that Buddha must have breathed his last somewhere here. The stature of Siwan has acquired more importance recently after the excavation of an idol of Lord Vishnu from the village Bherbania in Siwan district.

A native of Siwan, Uma Kant Singh, was killed by the British during the Quit India Movement. A peasant movement started by renowned author, Pandit Rahul Sankritayayana at Siwan, went to have huge repercussions on the freedom struggle, thus adding to the historic importance of the place.Mahatma Gandhi during the Champaran Movement stayed at Dr. Rajendra Prasad’s house at Jiradei.

<h2><li>Formation of Siwan district</li></h2>
<p>
In 1970, major changes were brought about in the jurisdiction of different places and Siwan was one of them. Siwan was declared a district following the new jurisdiction in 1972, and included 13 sub division blocks and 10 blocks of Gopalganj. In 1973, Gopalganj was removed from Siwan to constitute a separate district. siwan now comprised the 13 sub blocks and additional Bhagwanpur and Basantpur blocks. As a result of the implementation of Trivedi Award in 1970, keeping Ghaghara river as a focal point, some villages from Siwan were transferred to UP and vice-versa. The river changed everyone’s calculations when it changed course in 1885.Thereafter, a stable boundary was created at Siwan on both the banks of the river. Recently Siwan has got four more blocks which are Lakri Nabiganj, Nautan, Jiradei and Hasanpura, but only Lakri Nabiganj is functional as of now.Today, Siwan stands as a glorious example of India’s ancient heritage and as a torch-bearer of the sacrifices of great freedom fighters.
