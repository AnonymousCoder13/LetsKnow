            According to one belief about six hundred years ago a great suphie saint ‘Hazarat Makhdum Shah Shoeb Rahamatullah Aleh’ had founded the city of Sheikhpura. He settled over here and the dense forests were cleaned and people started settling over here. Later on it became densely populated.
            During the Pallava reign also Sheikhpura was one of the chief administrative centres. It is believed that the famous Afghan ruler Sher Shah Suri had got the famous ‘Dal Kuan’ constructed over here. Till now ‘Dal Kuan’ and Sheikhpura is believed to be synonymous with each other.
            During the mughal period, Sheikhpura got the status of Thana. In the British period Sheikhpura was accorded the status of Big Kotwali and after independence it was given the status of Block. On 14th April 1983 Sheikhpura became a Subdivision and on 31st July 1994 it was upgraded to District status.
