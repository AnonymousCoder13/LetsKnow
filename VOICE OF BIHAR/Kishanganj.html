            During the period of Khagada Nawab, Mohammed Fakiruddin, one hindu saint arrived, he was tired and wanted to rest at this place, but when he heard that this place name is Alamganj, the river name is Ramazan and the Jamindar name is Fakiruddin, he refused to enter at Alamganj. After that the Nawab decided and announced some portion from Kishanganj Gudri to Ramzan pool gandhi ghat as Krishna-Kunj. As time passed by the name got converted to present Kishanganj.
