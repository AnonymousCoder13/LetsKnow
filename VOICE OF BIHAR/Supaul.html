            Supaul, which was previously a part of Saharsa district, is now part of the Mithila region. Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by Indo-Aryan people, who established the Mithila Kingdom (also called Kingdom of the Videhas)
            During the late Vedic period (c. 1100–500 BCE), Videha, along with Kuru and Pañcāla, became one of the major political and cultural centres of South Asia. The kings of the Videha Kingdom were called Janakas. The Videha Kingdom was later incorporated into the Vajjika League, which had its capital in the city Vaishali, which is also in Mithila.
