            From epic time till today, the history of Champaran has been glorious and important. It is mentioned in the Purana that the devotee Dhruv, son of King Uttanapada, here had done terrible penance for attaining knowledge at the place called Tapovan. On the one hand, the land of Champaran is sacred due to the Goddess of Sita, on the other hand, the Satyagraha of Gandhiji in modern India is an invaluable page in the history of Indian independence. At the time of King Janak, this was part of the Tirahut kingdom. People believe that Jankigharh, also known as Chanchigarh, was the capital of King Janakâ€™s Veeveda state. Which later became part of the Vaishali empire in the 6th century BC. Lord Buddha had given his sermons here, in memory of which in the 3rd century BC, Priyadarshi Ashok made pillars and constructed stupas. After the decline of the Gupta Dynasty and the Pala Dynasty, the entire Champaran region, including Mithila, became subject to the Karnat dynasty. Local satraps were directly ruled by Muslims until and after this. Mahatma Gandhi came to Motihari in April 1917 on the call of Prince Shukla, a rayat of freedom and freedom fighter of India during the freedom struggle, and successfully used the first successful experiment of Satyagraha in protest of the three acrimonious cultivation of the Nil crop. This was the beginning of the new phase in the fight for independence. Later, Bapu came here many times. The British had made Champaran an independent unit in 1866, but in 1971 it was divided into Eastern and Western Champaran.
